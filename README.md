# Autarky-minigrid
Optimal Sizing and Dispatch for off-grid and weakly-connected mini-grids to support rural electrification. 

Autarky is a software tool designed to optimize community-scale electricity systems, typically mini-grids. It enables users to forecast electricity demand and renewable energy supply at specific GPS locations with an hourly resolution. There are four models available:
1. The regular model, which does not account for uncertainties.
2. The expected model, where all random parameters are replaced by their mean values.
3. The individual/joint chance-constrained models, which consider three/four types of uncertainties for weakly-connected mini-grids:
Stochastic renewable generation.
Demand forecast errors.
Main-grid outages and their onset times.
Outage durations.

Autarky also provides insights into the systemâ€™s technical performance, costs, and operational environmental impact.


Autarky was developed at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Humboldt University of Berlin as a tool for investigating ways to support rural electrification and the decentralization of electricity in urban communities. Since its continuous development began in 2022, Autarky has been used for planning studies in Sub-Saharan Africa, Germany, and Norway.
